## Why this ?

This model was created because of one frustrated [Ben Stewart](https://sbenstewart.in/) as his mom always comes at the very last possible moment and asks for some digital render for the season. In the year 2021 [Ben Stewart](https://sbenstewart.in/) pre-empts this, by creating this way ahead of time.

## How this ?

The tech stuff used are as follows:

1. Nothing really, just plain html, css and some custom JS.
2. Some basic geometry and math.
